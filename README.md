===========================
\$1=1+0j$  
\$1 \times j^2=(1+0j) \times j^2 = j^2 = -1 $  
- basically \$j$  means anticlockwise 90 degrees on additionally make-up (aka complex / imaginery) plane
- basically in rotation in computation we add this additionally make-up as the rotating axis
  - that is we add this axis in addition to x, y, z when it comes to 3D. in natural numbers we add z or y (both work exactly the same since they both make 1 dimension rotation possible)
